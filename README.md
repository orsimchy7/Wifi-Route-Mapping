# Wifi-Route-Mapping
Project's goal:
Mapping areas within a room or house where Wi-Fi signal strength is weak.

Summary:
In this project, I created a heatmap illustrating Wi-Fi signal strength within a room. To map the walking path, I utilized measurements from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in a mobile phone. In the initial phase, the sensors data were processed using a Python script. The mathematical calculations to determine the walking path were performed in MATLAB. Finally, I integrated the location data with the Wi-Fi signal strength data to generate the roomâ€™s heatmap.
